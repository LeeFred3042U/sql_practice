# **SQL Practice - My SQL Learning Path (IG maybe)**  

## **Purpose**  
This repository, **sql_practice**, contains all the SQL I have used in projects—whether they were just ideas, partially implemented, or fully completed.  

## **Folder Structure**  
- The folder names represent different **projects**:  
  - `never_done`  
  - `incomplete`  
  - `complete`  
  - `just_a_random_idea`  
- Each project folder contains subfolders for the **SQL components** used within that project.  
- Some subfolders may end with **Basic, Intermediate, or Advanced**, indicating the complexity of queries inside them (Ofc Maybe):  

  - **Basic** → Simple queries
  - **Intermediate** → Queries that are complex than Basic but not as advanced as Advanced  
  - **Advanced** → Complex queries

## **Note**  
The naming might seem random at first because **sql_practice** started as a beginner SQL practice space but later evolved into a structured collection of **projects involving databases**.
