# `sql_practice` — MySQL Learning Path

## Purpose

This repository is my personal SQL journey somewhat. It includes every SQL query I’ve written—ranging from random ideas and half-built experiments to fully completed projects or even nothing like no connection to any project

If you're looking to see how SQL is applied across different contexts and difficulty levels, this repo is a growing log of that evolution. I can't say for sure but will see with time. .^.

## Folder Structure

Each folder represents the development stage of a project, mostly you will find never done because "I don't really have an answer to that question", ohh also you wont be able to identify it until mentioned I guess.

### Subfolder Complexity Levels

I can't say for sure but mostly you will find sub-folders in which it may or may not say the level of complexuty but I guess you would be able to identify it while surfing, also in most you may not find any data ike a csv or inputs because technically its just insert query so just add your own. .^.

- `Basic/` → Simple queries (e.g. `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`)
- `Intermediate/` → Moderately complex logic (e.g. multiple joins, subqueries)
- `Advanced/` → Complex and optimized queries (e.g. nested subqueries, CTEs, window functions)

> ⚠️ **Note:** Well here's the play I didn't know any structure so I just evolves it through time and working my way to understanding of wjo knows what

## Who This Repo Is For

- **Students** → Use this as a reference to structure and improve your own SQL learning path or just creaye your own thing ahh I guess an AI can go iy
- **Recruiters** → This demonstrates my journey with SQL—from beginner basics to advanced querying, I really cant say if its true or not.
- **Me** → A personal archive of everything I've learned, built, and even dropped or even never done jusst random for no reason.

## Extras (Coming Soon, Maybe I Just asked ChatGPT for this and it gave this)

- ✅ Query performance tips
- ✅ Optimization attempts with `EXPLAIN`
- ✅ SQL + Python integrations
- ✅ Practice datasets (e.g. CSVs)
